------------------------------------------------------------------------
r1192 | shadowed.wow | 2009-04-03 23:53:54 -0700 (Fri, 03 Apr 2009) | 4 lines

* Stripped the old Action Bar Saver -> Action Bar Saver 2 conversion code it's been almost a year "should" be fine
* Stripped all of the companion saving for 3.0, it doesn't work half the time and is ugly anyway
* Removed localization.deDE.lua and localization.frFR.lua not like I ever use them

------------------------------------------------------------------------
r1191 | shadowed.wow | 2009-04-03 23:39:52 -0700 (Fri, 03 Apr 2009) | 1 line

------------------------------------------------------------------------
r1190 | shadowed.wow | 2009-04-03 23:39:30 -0700 (Fri, 03 Apr 2009) | 5 lines

* Changed companion saving to use the new Blizzard functions that actually work (And only took like 6 months to work)
* Cleaned up some code in general to be less ugly and weird in general
* Updated TOC to 3.1
* Stripped Ace3, can't remember why I added it in the first place

------------------------------------------------------------------------
r1057 | shadowed.wow | 2009-01-08 14:10:31 -0800 (Thu, 08 Jan 2009) | 1 line

* Added debug code if the companion scanning fails, hopefully this will let me narrow down whats causing it to happen (HOPEFULLY)
------------------------------------------------------------------------
r1055 | shadowed.wow | 2009-01-04 20:16:33 -0800 (Sun, 04 Jan 2009) | 1 line

r1052 | shadowed.wow | 2009-01-04 09:10:09 -0800 (Sun, 04 Jan 2009) | 1 line

* Added an option to restore the actual spell rank saved, instead of defaulting to the highest rank (/abs rank, restores highest rank by default)
------------------------------------------------------------------------
r1026 | shadowed.wow | 2008-11-23 09:02:46 -0800 (Sun, 23 Nov 2008) | 2 lines

* Added a check to prevent profiles from being restored in combat
* Since down ranking was removed, we don't really benefit from having lower ranks of spells restored, meaning it will now default to restoring the highest rank, and if that fails it'll restore the rank saved
------------------------------------------------------------------------
r993 | shadowed.wow | 2008-10-30 15:05:14 -0700 (Thu, 30 Oct 2008) | 4 lines

* Fixed an issue with saving profiles as a Paladin or Warlock because Blizzard likes inconsistencies because they're evil bastards
* Updated libraries
* Updated TOC
* Removed build 30000 checks
------------------------------------------------------------------------
r930 | shadowed.wow | 2008-09-21 11:32:22 -0700 (Sun, 21 Sep 2008) | 3 lines

* Updated AceDB-3.0

------------------------------------------------------------------------
r929 | shadowed.wow | 2008-09-21 11:26:12 -0700 (Sun, 21 Sep 2008) | 3 lines

* Changed the macro check to 36 global/18 character since Blizzard lied apparently
* Added a work around for companions not returning a valid GetActionInfo
* Stripped out AceConfig, AceDBOptions, AceEvent, AceGUI, as I can't think of any case I'm going to use these in the future
------------------------------------------------------------------------
r898 | shadowed.wow | 2008-09-07 13:54:48 -0700 (Sun, 07 Sep 2008) | 2 lines

* Apparently blizzard didn't up the per character macros to 36 yet, so removed that check
* Fixed /abs macro and /abs count not giving the correct response and always saying disabled
------------------------------------------------------------------------
r887 | shadowed.wow | 2008-08-31 15:09:37 -0700 (Sun, 31 Aug 2008) | 2 lines

* Should mostly work with WoTLK now, just need to add mount/companion parts in
* Added Bazaar support
------------------------------------------------------------------------
r836 | shadowed.wow | 2008-08-02 21:21:56 -0700 (Sat, 02 Aug 2008) | 3 lines

* Fixed macro check, only does it if we find a macro we need to restore
* Fixed /abs macro not actually working and letting you disable it
* Added spell linking, this is very basic and for general substitution like if you have a Tauren Druid and a Night Elf Druid, you can set it up so if it can't find War Stomp it uses Shadow Meld in it's place and vica versa.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
r802 | shadowed.wow | 2008-07-04 16:57:43 -0700 (Fri, 04 Jul 2008) | 2 lines

------------------------------------------------------------------------
r784 | shadowed.wow | 2008-06-25 10:37:47 -0700 (Wed, 25 Jun 2008) | 5 lines

* Fixed spells not being restored if they were the max ranks
* Fixed /abs delete not deleting unknown profiles
* Cleaned up the restore code slightly
* Added /abs rename old new for renaming profiles, also will move them to your current classes category

------------------------------------------------------------------------
r781 | shadowed.wow | 2008-06-20 16:44:59 -0700 (Fri, 20 Jun 2008) | 5 lines

* Moved ABS to Ace3 to clean up the code a bit more, game restart IS required
* Slash command is still /abs
* Added /abs count toggles checking if you have an item in your inventory before restoring, may need this enabled on this like Arena Tournament Realm to prevent disconnecting issues
* Cleaned up the storage format, we now store profiles per class so you can use names like pve/pvp for different class sets without issues, you can now also only restore sets that were saved on that class
* Improved the code in general, saving, restoring, adding macros and such are all less ugly and good things like that
------------------------------------------------------------------------
r717 | shadowed.wow | 2008-05-17 17:23:11 -0700 (Sat, 17 May 2008) | 2 lines

* Added a quick check to string format for macroID to prevent a nil error
* Fixed a bug in macro searching, will actually search for macros now if they go missing or the ID changed
------------------------------------------------------------------------
r673 | shadowed.wow | 2008-04-16 11:06:11 -0700 (Wed, 16 Apr 2008) | 1 line

* Oops, left debug code in. Won't spam spell names anymore.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
r669 | shadowed.wow | 2008-04-15 13:45:16 -0700 (Tue, 15 Apr 2008) | 1 line

* Added a quick hack in to prevent things with : in them from causing format issues
------------------------------------------------------------------------
r649 | shadowed.wow | 2008-04-03 15:58:27 -0700 (Thu, 03 Apr 2008) | 1 line

* Updated our restore logic, it appears with 2.4 Blizzard changed the way dynamic icon macros are done so it'll specifically say the macro to the last known icon. Because we don't seem to be able to pull out if it's a dynamic icon macro or not, will just stop using it for identification
------------------------------------------------------------------------
r621 | shadowed.wow | 2008-03-09 18:55:41 -0700 (Sun, 09 Mar 2008) | 1 line

* Fixed a bug with attempt to index nil table profileData
------------------------------------------------------------------------
r617 | shadowed.wow | 2008-03-08 22:01:02 -0800 (Sat, 08 Mar 2008) | 3 lines

* New option, /abs macro will toggle auto recreation of saved macros if they aren't found, defaults to off and will first create in per-character slot until it fills up.
* Mainly this is for developers, or things like transferring your layout/macros to a different character like the tournament realm easier. Requires the save to have been done with a r615 or later of ABS
* Auto save on logout is now defaulted to off instead of on
------------------------------------------------------------------------
r616 | shadowed.wow | 2008-03-08 17:09:03 -0800 (Sat, 08 Mar 2008) | 3 lines

* Switched to localization.*.lua files, GAME RESTART IS REEQUIRED BECAUSE OF THIS
* Fixed auto save, we now store your current profile per character instead of globally so it won't attempt to auto save a Druids profile on a Rogue (for example)
* Improved /abs list, will now save the name/realm that a profile was created for and will list it per that group to make it easier. Any profile that hasn't been saved/restored yet will show up as misc.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
r615 | shadowed.wow | 2008-03-07 23:26:49 -0800 (Fri, 07 Mar 2008) | 7 lines

* Lots of improvements in this!
* Restoring is more verbose, will specifically report what spell/macro/item couldn't be restored and to what slot, if an error occurs it'll say something like "Restored <name>, failed to restore <errors> buttons type /abs errors for more info"
* Instead of bag scanning, we use PickupItem instead, this also fixes a bug with items that aren't in your bag but are equipped not being restored
* Full rank is now saved instead of only numeric ones, "just in case".
* Removed all tooltip scanning, replaced it with GetSpellName calls, this should fix issues with auto save not working
* We now identify macros using name/icon/macro text, if we find a macro id doesn't match our saved info then will scan all ids until we can find the matching one and then restore that, this fixes issues with deleting macros and causing it to restore profiles incorrectly

------------------------------------------------------------------------
r524 | shadowed.wow | 2008-01-25 19:18:57 -0800 (Fri, 25 Jan 2008) | 1 line

* Switched to using a spell name/rank -> index cache for restoring so we don't do around 400-600+ tooltip scans per a restore
------------------------------------------------------------------------
r522 | shadowed.wow | 2008-01-25 01:13:13 -0800 (Fri, 25 Jan 2008) | 1 line

* All future profile saves will use spell name/rank instead of spell book id this should resolve issues with the restored profile being completely messed up due to respeccing
------------------------------------------------------------------------
r514 | shadowed.wow | 2008-01-19 12:31:23 -0800 (Sat, 19 Jan 2008) | 3 lines

* Added ClearCursor after doing a place action
* We no longer check and make sure we have to change it, we simply change it anyway
* Added tonumber to crtID to prevent API issues
------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------
r490 | shadowed.wow | 2008-01-05 23:25:41 -0800 (Sat, 05 Jan 2008) | 3 lines
